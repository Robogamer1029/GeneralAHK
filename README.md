# GeneralAHK
An AHK script that does a lot of general things. I'm unoriginal so its called GeneralAHK. Some stuff in the script *might* break tos of some services to not be mad at me if your account gets banned or suspended or otherwise :)

The DisableInterwebs.bat is a batch file that runs on a press of probably CTRL, ALT, and F9. 
It was made to do a cool and get more money in GTAOnline.

The text file is a list of some fun stuff and Minecraft splash text it is used to spam a discord server every 1 minute to get high levels in Mee6. Bacon is the owner.

The real juicy bit and the core of it all is the AHK script.
Read it.
You dont have to read this.
Shut up. I don't care its a README, this is dumb just install it somewhere and run it.

Oh yeah. I should mention that all the stuff should be in the same folder or it won't work. Well all the hotkeys that don't need those other 2 files, the text file and the batch file, will work fine, probably.
